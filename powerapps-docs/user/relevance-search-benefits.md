# What is relevance search 

Relevance Search for model-driven apps helps you quickly find what you're looking. It delivers fast and comprehensive results across multiple tables in a single list that's sorted by relevance. 
  
Benefits of Relevance Search:  

- **Fast and accurate search**: Precise and quick search experience for model-driven apps and superior performance than [Categorized search](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/user/quick-find#multiple-table-quick-find-categorized-search). 

- **Suggested results as you type**: Find what you're looking for and see the top results, as you type.

- **Better matching**: Finds matches to any word in the search term for columns in a table. Provides a better user experience compared to [quick find](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/user/quick-find) search, where all words in the search term must be found in one column. 

- **Smart**: Finds matches that include inflectional words such as stream, streaming, or streamed. 

- **Search across documents in Microsoft Dataverse**: Includes search results for text in a document that's stored in Microsoft Dataverse such as PDF, Microsoft Office documents, HTML, XML, ZIP, EML, plain text, and, JSON file formats. It also searches text in notes and attachments. 

- **Understanding of underlying data**: Relevance Search understands data types like choices and lookups to interpret a search query with multiple search terms effectively. 

- **Operators for advanced search**: Use simple Boolean operators in your search term and craft the query to get the results you want. 

- **Intelligence**: Relevance Search applies artificial intelligence technology to interpret natural language such as misspellings, common abbreviations, and synonyms to delivers quality results.
