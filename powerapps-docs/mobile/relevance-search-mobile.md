# Use relevance search for model-driven apps using the Power Apps mobile app (preview)

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Quickly find the information that you are looking for using Relevance search. The Relevance search experience delivers fast and comprehensive results across multiple tables, in a single list, sorted by relevance.

Relevance Search is already available when you're using a model-driven app in a web browser. The functionality is the same but it works a little differently when you're using it with the mobile app. For more information, see [Using relevance search to search for rows](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/user/relevance-search).

Before you begin using Relevance Search, the new experience needs to be enabled by the administrator for your organization. For more information, see [Enable the new Relevance Search experience](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/configure-relevance-search-organization#enable-the-new-relevance-search-experience).
